# FavoriteList

This is for practicing coding. This is a quick wannabe app to rank your favorite movies. Right now I make a new table each movie franchise, but I may change it to have a bunch of entries in one table & make more tables for things other than movies.

How the script works is just answer the questions.

Pre-Req: you pretty much have to have a specific set-up... will work on that in the future :)
